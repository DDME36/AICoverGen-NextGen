# RVC Voice Models

Place your RVC v2 voice models here.

Each model should be in its own folder with:
- model_name.pth (required)
- model_name.index (optional, but recommended)

Example structure:
```
rvc_models/
├── Singer1/
│   ├── Singer1.pth
│   └── Singer1.index
├── Singer2/
│   ├── Singer2.pth
│   └── Singer2.index
└── hubert_base.pt (downloaded automatically)
